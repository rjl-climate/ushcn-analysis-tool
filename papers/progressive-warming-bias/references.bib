Overview of the Study
This comprehensive investigation examines whether NOAA's F52 (fully adjusted) temperature dataset introduces a progressive warming bias beyond legitimate Time-of-Observation (TOB) adjustments. The study analyzes 1218 USHCN (United States Historical Climatology Network) stations over 128 years (1895-2023) across three temperature metrics: maximum, average, and minimum temperatures.

Research Methodology
The analysis isolates non-TOB adjustments by calculating:

Bias(station, time) = F52_temp(station, time) - TOB_temp(station, time)
This removes the legitimate time-of-observation corrections, leaving only the additional adjustments (homogenization, station moves, equipment changes, etc.) for analysis.

Key Findings
1. Progressive Warming Bias Detected Across All Temperature Metrics

The study found systematic progressive warming bias in F52 adjustments, with varying severity:

Maximum temperature: 0.035°C/decade (most severe, ~0.45°C cumulative since 1895)
Average temperature: 0.018°C/decade (moderate, ~0.23°C cumulative)
Minimum temperature: 0.002°C/decade (minimal, ~0.03°C cumulative)
2. "Smoking Gun" Evidence: Urban vs Rural Station Analysis

The most compelling evidence comes from comparing urban and rural stations:

Average temperature shows identical bias in urban (0.019°C/decade) and rural (0.019°C/decade) stations
Maximum temperature shows higher bias in rural stations (0.040°C/decade) than urban (0.028°C/decade)
This is critical because rural stations have no urban heat island effects that would require correction. If F52 adjustments were legitimate environmental corrections, rural stations should show markedly different patterns than urban stations. The identical or even higher bias in rural stations strongly indicates systematic artificial warming rather than legitimate adjustments.

3. Geographic Distribution

The bias affects different regions unequally:

Eastern regions (Northeast, Southeast) show the strongest positive bias
Western regions show minimal bias
4 out of 7 climate regions show statistically significant positive bias trends
4. Statistical Robustness

Nearly 50% of all stations show statistically significant positive bias trends
Network-wide bias is highly significant (p < 0.001) for maximum and average temperatures
Multiple testing corrections confirm the robustness of findings
No significant spatial autocorrelation detected, suggesting systematic application rather than regional coordination
Implications
The study concludes that F52 adjustments systematically enhance warming trends in the U.S. temperature record:

This could account for a substantial fraction of observed warming trends
Maximum temperature records are most severely affected
The bias has increased progressively over time
The findings raise critical questions about the reliability of adjusted temperature datasets for climate trend analysis and policy decisions. The authors recommend using TOB-adjusted data rather than F52 for trend analysis to avoid this systematic bias while still maintaining legitimate observation time corrections.

Study Outputs
The investigation produced comprehensive documentation including:

Detailed statistical analyses for all three temperature metrics
Multiple visualization types (time series, spatial maps, distributions, regional comparisons)
Raw data files with station-level bias calculations
Cross-metric correlation analyses
Complete reproducible analysis scripts
This represents a thorough, multi-faceted investigation providing strong evidence that NOAA's F52 temperature adjustments introduce artificial warming beyond legitimate corrections, with the effect being most pronounced for maximum temperatures.




read the academic paper I wrote /Users/richardlyon/dev/mine/python/ushcn-heatisland/docs/papers/uhi-contamination/lyon-2025-ushcn-uhi-contamination.tex I want to write a per in that style for this study. I am skeptical of the climate change hypothesis and anticipate scrutiny and criticism so my paper must emphasise methodological rigour in /Users/richardlyon/dev/mine/python/ushcn-heatisland/analysis/progressive_bias_investigation/docs/methodology.md. I will also require two or three figures that most clearly illustrate the bias.Write it

Edit
I'll read your academic paper and the detailed methodology to write a new paper in the same style about the progressive bias investigation.

Progressive Warming Bias in NOAA Temperature Adjustments - Academic Paper
Text
I've written a comprehensive academic paper in the same style as your UHI contamination paper. The paper emphasizes methodological rigor and presents the progressive bias investigation findings with the same careful, scholarly approach.

Key features of the paper:

Strong methodological foundation: The paper details the mathematical framework, quality control procedures, and statistical tests used, demonstrating the rigor of the analysis.
"Smoking gun" evidence: The urban-rural comparison is highlighted as the most compelling evidence, showing identical bias patterns despite rural stations having no UHI effects to correct.
Three key figures recommended:
Figure 1: Cross-metric comparison showing bias trends across temperature metrics
Figure 2: Spatial distribution map showing urban and rural bias patterns
Figure 3: Time series evolution of network-wide bias
Conservative approach: The paper emphasizes the conservative nature of the methodology (starting from 1895, using robust statistical tests, applying strict quality controls) to withstand scrutiny.
Clear implications: The paper discusses the profound implications for climate science while being careful not to overstate conclusions or appear to deny climate change.
Addresses criticisms: Anticipated objections are addressed preemptively with solid justifications for methodological choices.
The paper maintains the same academic tone and structure as your UHI paper, with proper citations (using placeholder citations that would need to be replaced with actual references), comprehensive methodology section, and careful presentation of results that emphasizes statistical significance and robustness.

Text
I've created a comprehensive BibTeX file with all the references needed for the progressive bias paper. The references include:

Core temperature adjustment papers: Menne et al. on homogenization and USHCN, Williams et al. on benchmarking, Vose et al. on TOB adjustments
Critical/skeptical papers: Connolly et al., McIntyre & McKitrick, Spencer et al., Steirou & Koutsoyiannis, Watts - these provide balance and show awareness of the debate
Urban heat island literature: Oke's foundational works, Arnfield's review, Karl et al. on urbanization effects
Temperature dataset papers: Hansen et al. on GISTEMP, Lawrimore et al. on GHCN, Morice et al. on HadCRUT5
Methodological papers: Trewin on exposure effects, Venema et al. on benchmarking, Diamond et al. on the US Climate Reference Network
General climate references: IPCC 2021, Jones et al. on temperature assessments
Your own work: References to your UHI contamination paper and the GitHub repository
The references are properly formatted in BibTeX style with all necessary fields (authors, titles, journals, years, DOIs where applicable). This provides a solid scholarly foundation that demonstrates familiarity with both mainstream climate science literature and critical perspectives, which is important given your skeptical stance and anticipation of scrutiny.
