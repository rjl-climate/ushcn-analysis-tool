Executive Summary \u00b6 This study investigates whether NOAA temperature adjustments successfully remove urban heat island (UHI) contamination from the US temperature record. Analysis of 126 years of data from 1,218 weather stations reveals that adjustments actually enhance urban warming signals rather than removing them. Primary Results \u00b6 Dataset UHII (\u00b0C) Change from Raw p-value Effect Size Raw 0.662 \u2014 0.004 d = 0.58 TOBs Adjusted 0.522 -21.1% 0.022 d = 0.46 Fully Adjusted 0.725 +9.4% <0.001 d = 0.97 Dual Contamination Pattern \u00b6 The analysis reveals two distinct forms of urban heat island contamination: Baseline Temperature Elevation : 2.98\u00b0C persistent difference between urban and rural stations Differential Warming Trend : 0.725\u00b0C additional warming in urban areas over 126 years Total Effect : ~3.7\u00b0C combined contamination affecting 22.7% of stations Research Context \u00b6 The Challenge \u00b6 The US Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) provides critical temperature data for climate assessments. NOAA applies adjustments to remove non-climatic biases including: Time-of-observation changes Station relocations Equipment changes Urban heat island effects The effectiveness of these adjustments in removing urban warming signals has significant implications for climate science. Urban Heat Islands \u00b6 Urban areas create localized warming through: Reduced evapotranspiration from vegetation loss Increased heat absorption by built surfaces Anthropogenic heat release Modified atmospheric circulation Given that many weather stations are in or near growing population centers, UHI contamination poses a significant challenge to temperature record integrity. Methodology \u00b6 Analysis Framework \u00b6 We employed a \"steel-man\" approach, using parameters that maximize urban heat island detection: Time Period : 1895-2020 (126 years) Baseline : 1895-1924 Current : 1991-2020 Temperature Metric : Minimum temperatures (strongest UHI signal) Network : 1,218 USHCN stations Urban Classification \u00b6 Stations classified by distance to population centers: Urban Core : <25km from cities \u2265250,000 (26 stations, 2.1%) Urban Fringe : 25-50km from cities \u2265100,000 (120 stations, 9.9%) Suburban : 50-100km from cities \u226550,000 (405 stations, 33.3%) Rural : >100km from cities \u226550,000 (667 stations, 54.8%) Calculations \u00b6 Temperature Anomaly = Mean(Current Period) - Mean(Baseline Period) UHII = Mean(Urban Anomalies) - Mean(Rural Anomalies) Statistical Methods \u00b6 Independent samples t-test Mann-Whitney U test Cohen's d effect size 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap Key Findings \u00b6 The Adjustment Paradox \u00b6 NOAA's adjustment process creates an unexpected U-shaped pattern : graph LR A[Raw Data<br/>0.662\u00b0C] -->|TOBs Adjustment<br/>-21.1%| B[TOBs Adjusted<br/>0.522\u00b0C] B -->|Homogenization<br/>+38.8%| C[Fully Adjusted<br/>0.725\u00b0C] style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px This suggests that while time-of-observation corrections reduce urban signals, subsequent homogenization procedures more than reverse this reduction. Absolute Temperature Differences \u00b6 Beyond differential warming trends, urban stations show persistent baseline elevation: Minimum Temperature UHI : 2.98\u00b0C (year-round) Maximum Temperature UHI : 0.59\u00b0C (summer) The 5\u00d7 difference between nighttime and daytime UHI aligns with established urban thermal dynamics. Network Quality Considerations \u00b6 Analysis revealed critical network coverage issues: Pre-1895: Only 64 average stations (inadequate) 1890-1908: 5\u00d7 expansion potentially creating artifacts Post-1908: Stable 1,218 stations (adequate coverage) We constrained analysis to post-1895 to ensure reliable results. Implications \u00b6 For the United States \u00b6 With only 2.1% of stations in urban cores and 36 people/km\u00b2, the US represents a best-case scenario . Yet we still find: 22.7% of stations affected by UHI 0.725\u00b0C warming trend contamination 2.98\u00b0C baseline contamination Enhancement rather than removal by adjustments Global Extrapolation \u00b6 More densely populated regions face greater challenges: Country Population Density Relative to US Expected UHI Impact USA 36 people/km\u00b2 1.0\u00d7 22.7% contamination UK 275 people/km\u00b2 7.6\u00d7 Much higher Germany 240 people/km\u00b2 6.7\u00d7 Much higher Japan 347 people/km\u00b2 9.6\u00d7 Much higher Netherlands 508 people/km\u00b2 14.1\u00d7 Severe Climate Science Impact \u00b6 Temperature Records : Both baseline and trend contamination persist Model Validation : Observational data contains systematic warm biases Policy Targets : Temperature goals may need recalibration Attribution Studies : Urban warming conflated with climate signals Reproducing Results \u00b6 Main Finding \u00b6 # Reproduce Table 2 from paper ushcn-heatisland analyze adjustment_impact \\ --temp-metric min \\ --baseline-start-year 1895 \\ --current-start-year 1991 \\ --period-length 30 Expected output: Raw UHII: 0.662\u00b0C TOBs UHII: 0.522\u00b0C (-21.1%) Fully Adjusted UHII: 0.725\u00b0C (+9.4%) Enhanced Analysis \u00b6 # Network quality-informed analysis cd analysis/ushcn_uhii_analysis_1895_plus python create_min_temp_uhii_plot_1895.py Results: 2.975\u00b0C minimum temperature UHI Visualizations \u00b6 # Generate Figure 1 cd analysis/network_visualisation python create_network_visualisation.py Conclusions \u00b6 NOAA adjustments enhance rather than remove urban heat island signals The enhancement (+9.4%) results from homogenization procedures Total UHI contamination approaches 3.7\u00b0C for affected stations 22.7% of the USHCN network experiences this contamination Global implications likely more severe in densely populated regions Future Research \u00b6 Immediate Priorities \u00b6 Analyze temperature networks in Europe, East Asia Investigate why homogenization enhances urban signals Compare with satellite temperature records Station-by-station adjustment analysis Long-term Goals \u00b6 Global GHCN analysis Alternative homogenization methods Machine learning approaches Policy recommendation development References \u00b6 Lyon, R.
