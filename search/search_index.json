Executive Summary \u00b6 This study investigates whether NOAA's F52 temperature adjustments introduce progressive warming bias by analyzing 1,218 USHCN stations over 128 years (1895-2023). By isolating non-TOB adjustments and comparing urban versus rural stations, we demonstrate that homogenization procedures systematically add warming to the temperature record rather than removing environmental biases. Primary Results \u00b6 Temperature Metric Bias Trend (\u00b0C/decade) Cumulative Since 1895 Stations Affected Urban Trend Rural Trend Maximum 0.035 ~0.45\u00b0C 54.6% (665/1218) 0.028 0.040 Average 0.018 ~0.23\u00b0C 48.9% (596/1218) 0.019 0.019 Minimum 0.002 ~0.03\u00b0C 41.1% (501/1218) 0.011 -0.001 \"Smoking Gun\" Evidence \u00b6 The urban-rural comparison reveals the critical finding: Average temperature : Identical bias in urban (0.019) and rural (0.019) stations Maximum temperature : Rural stations receive larger warming adjustments than urban Significance : Rural stations have no urban heat island effects requiring correction This pattern cannot be reconciled with legitimate environmental adjustments. Research Context \u00b6 The Challenge \u00b6 The integrity of temperature records depends on adjustment procedures designed to remove non-climatic artifacts: Station relocations Equipment changes Time-of-observation shifts Environmental modifications NOAA applies multi-stage adjustments progressing from raw data through TOB corrections to fully adjusted (F52) datasets. The systematic impact of these adjustments on long-term trends has profound implications for climate assessments. Progressive Bias Hypothesis \u00b6 If adjustment procedures introduce systematic warming over time, this would: - Contaminate temperature trend calculations - Affect climate model validation - Compromise attribution studies - Impact policy decisions based on warming magnitude Methodology \u00b6 Mathematical Framework \u00b6 For each station i at time t , we calculated adjustment bias: Bias(i,t) = F52_temp(i,t) - TOB_temp(i,t) This isolates homogenization impacts from well-understood TOB corrections.

Executive Summary \u00b6 This study investigates whether NOAA temperature adjustments successfully remove urban heat island (UHI) contamination from the US temperature record. Analysis of 126 years of data from 1,218 weather stations reveals that adjustments actually enhance urban warming signals rather than removing them.

NOAA applies adjustments to remove non-climatic biases including: Time-of-observation changes Station relocations Equipment changes Urban heat island effects The effectiveness of these adjustments in removing urban warming signals has significant implications for climate science. Urban Heat Islands \u00b6 Urban areas create localized warming through: Reduced evapotranspiration from vegetation loss Increased heat absorption by built surfaces Anthropogenic heat release Modified atmospheric circulation Given that many weather stations are in or near growing population centers, UHI contamination poses a significant challenge to temperature record integrity. Methodology \u00b6 Analysis Framework \u00b6 We employed a \"steel-man\" approach, using parameters that maximize urban heat island detection: Time Period : 1895-2020 (126 years) Baseline : 1895-1924 Current : 1991-2020 Temperature Metric : Minimum temperatures (strongest UHI signal) Network : 1,218 USHCN stations Urban Classification \u00b6 Stations classified by distance to population centers: Urban Core : <25km from cities \u2265250,000 (26 stations, 2.1%) Urban Fringe : 25-50km from cities \u2265100,000 (120 stations, 9.9%) Suburban : 50-100km from cities \u226550,000 (405 stations, 33.3%) Rural : >100km from cities \u226550,000 (667 stations, 54.8%) Calculations \u00b6 Temperature Anomaly = Mean(Current Period) - Mean(Baseline Period) UHII = Mean(Urban Anomalies) - Mean(Rural Anomalies) Statistical Methods \u00b6 Independent samples t-test Mann-Whitney U test Cohen's d effect size 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap Key Findings \u00b6 The Adjustment Paradox \u00b6 NOAA's adjustment process creates an unexpected U-shaped pattern : graph LR A[Raw Data<br/>0.662\u00b0C] -->|TOBs Adjustment<br/>-21.1%| B[TOBs Adjusted<br/>0.522\u00b0C] B -->|Homogenization<br/>+38.8%| C[Fully Adjusted<br/>0.725\u00b0C] style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px This suggests that while time-of-observation corrections reduce urban signals, subsequent homogenization procedures more than reverse this reduction. Absolute Temperature Differences \u00b6 Beyond differential warming trends, urban stations show persistent baseline elevation: Minimum Temperature UHI : 2.98\u00b0C (year-round) Maximum Temperature UHI : 0.59\u00b0C (summer) The 5\u00d7 difference between nighttime and daytime UHI aligns with established urban thermal dynamics. Network Quality Considerations \u00b6 Analysis revealed critical network coverage issues: Pre-1895: Only 64 average stations (inadequate) 1890-1908: 5\u00d7 expansion potentially creating artifacts Post-1908: Stable 1,218 stations (adequate coverage) We constrained analysis to post-1895 to ensure reliable results. Implications \u00b6 For the United States \u00b6 With only 2.1% of stations in urban cores and 36 people/km\u00b2, the US represents a best-case scenario . Yet we still find: 22.7% of stations affected by UHI 0.725\u00b0C warming trend contamination 2.98\u00b0C baseline contamination Enhancement rather than removal by adjustments Global Extrapolation \u00b6 More densely populated regions face greater challenges: Country Population Density Relative to US Expected UHI Impact USA 36 people/km\u00b2 1.0\u00d7 22.7% contamination UK 275 people/km\u00b2 7.6\u00d7 Much higher Germany 240 people/km\u00b2 6.7\u00d7 Much higher Japan 347 people/km\u00b2 9.6\u00d7 Much higher Netherlands 508 people/km\u00b2 14.1\u00d7 Severe Climate Science Impact \u00b6 Temperature Records : Both baseline and trend contamination persist Model Validation : Observational data contains systematic warm biases Policy Targets : Temperature goals may need recalibration Attribution Studies : Urban warming conflated with climate signals Reproducing Results \u00b6 Main Finding \u00b6 # Reproduce Table 2 from paper ushcn-heatisland analyze adjustment_impact \\ --temp-metric min \\ --baseline-start-year 1895 \\ --current-start-year 1991 \\ --period-length 30 Expected output: Raw UHII: 0.662\u00b0C TOBs UHII: 0.522\u00b0C (-21.1%) Fully Adjusted UHII: 0.725\u00b0C (+9.4%) Enhanced Analysis \u00b6 # Network quality-informed analysis cd analysis/ushcn_uhii_analysis_1895_plus python create_min_temp_uhii_plot_1895.py Results: 2.975\u00b0C minimum temperature UHI Visualizations \u00b6 # Generate Figure 1 cd analysis/network_visualisation python create_network_visualisation.py Conclusions \u00b6 NOAA adjustments enhance rather than remove urban heat island signals The enhancement (+9.4%) results from homogenization procedures Total UHI contamination approaches 3.7\u00b0C for affected stations 22.7% of the USHCN network experiences this contamination Global implications likely more severe in densely populated regions Future Research \u00b6 Immediate Priorities \u00b6 Analyze temperature networks in Europe, East Asia Investigate why homogenization enhances urban signals Compare with satellite temperature records Station-by-station adjustment analysis Long-term Goals \u00b6 Global GHCN analysis Alternative homogenization methods Machine learning approaches Policy recommendation development References \u00b6 Lyon, R.

Mathematical Framework \u00b6 1.1 Bias Definition \u00b6 For each station i at time t , we define the adjustment bias as: B(i,t) = T_F52(i,t) - T_TOB(i,t) Where: - T_F52(i,t) = Fully adjusted (F52) temperature for station i at time t - T_TOB(i,t) = Time-of-observation adjusted temperature for station i at time t - B(i,t) = Non-TOB adjustment applied by NOAA This isolates the adjustments beyond TOB corrections, including: - Homogenization adjustments - Station move corrections - Equipment change adjustments - Urban heat island \"corrections\" 1.2 Trend Calculation \u00b6 For each station, we calculate the temporal trend using ordinary least squares regression: B(i,t) = \u03b2\u2080(i) + \u03b2\u2081(i) \u00d7 t + \u03b5(i,t) Where: - \u03b2\u2081(i) = Bias trend for station i (\u00b0C/year) - \u03b2\u2080(i) = Intercept (baseline bias) - \u03b5(i,t) = Residual error The key metric is \u03b2\u2081(i) \u00d7 10 = trend per decade 1.3 Network-Wide Analysis \u00b6 The network-wide bias trend is calculated as: \u03b2\u0304\u2081 = (1/N) \u00d7 \u03a3\u1d62 \u03b2\u2081(i) With standard error: SE(\u03b2\u0304\u2081) = \u03c3(\u03b2\u2081) / \u221aN 2. Data Processing Steps \u00b6 2.1 Data Loading and Matching \u00b6 Load TOB adjusted data for all stations Load F52 adjusted data for all stations Match records by: Station ID Year Month 2.2 Quality Control \u00b6 Temporal Coverage : Require minimum 10 years of data Annual Completeness : Require \u22656 months per year Trend Reliability : Require \u226530 data points for trend calculation Start Year Filter (for urban/rural analysis): Require first year \u22641905 to ensure consistent long-term coverage from 1895 baseline 2.3 Bias Calculation \u00b6 For each matched record: 1. Calculate monthly bias: B = F52 - TOB 2. Aggregate to annual means (requiring \u22656 months) 3. Apply linear regression to annual time series 3. Statistical Tests \u00b6 3.1 Individual Station Significance \u00b6 For each station trend, we test: - H\u2080 : \u03b2\u2081(i) = 0 (no temporal trend) - H\u2081 : \u03b2\u2081(i) \u2260 0 (significant trend) Using t-test with significance level \u03b1 = 0.05 3.2 Network-Wide Tests \u00b6 Mann-Kendall Test \u00b6 Non-parametric test for monotonic trends in the network-wide mean bias: S = \u03a3\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u207f\u207b\u00b9 \u03a3\u2c7c\u208c\u1d62\u208a\u2081\u207f sgn(B\u2c7c - B\u1d62) Where sgn is the signum function. Breakpoint Detection \u00b6 Using Pettitt's test to identify sudden changes in adjustment patterns: U\u2096 = \u03a3\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u1d4f \u03a3\u2c7c\u208c\u2096\u208a\u2081\u207f sgn(B\u2c7c - B\u1d62) The most probable breakpoint occurs at k where |U\u2096| is maximum. 3.3 Spatial Analysis \u00b6 Test for spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I: I = (N/W) \u00d7 (\u03a3\u1d62 \u03a3\u2c7c w\u1d62\u2c7c(\u03b2\u1d62 - \u03b2\u0304)(\u03b2\u2c7c - \u03b2\u0304)) / (\u03a3\u1d62(\u03b2\u1d62 - \u03b2\u0304)\u00b2) Where w\u1d62\u2c7c are spatial weights based on distance. 4. Control Analyses \u00b6 4.1 Urban vs Rural Stratification \u00b6 Station Classification \u00b6 Stations are classified based on distance to cities with population >50,000: - Urban Core : \u226425 km from large city - Urban : 25-50 km from large city - Suburban : 50-100 km from large city - Rural : >100 km from any large city For analysis, these are simplified to binary classification: - Urban : Stations within 100 km of cities >50k population (includes urban core, urban, and suburban) - Rural : Stations >100 km from any city >50k population Temporal Filtering for Urban/Rural Analysis \u00b6 To ensure consistent time series comparison, stations are filtered by data availability: - Inclusion criterion : Station must have first year of data \u2264 1905 (within 10 years of 1895 start) - Rationale : Ensures all analyzed stations cover most of the study period (1895-2023) - Impact : Excludes 269 stations (22.1%) that began recording after 1905 - Result : 949 stations analyzed (668 urban, 281 rural) This temporal filtering prevents bias from comparing stations with vastly different recording periods and ensures robust long-term trend analysis. We test if bias trends differ between groups using Welch's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. 4.2 Regional Stratification \u00b6 Stations are grouped by climate regions to control for: - Regional climate variations - Policy implementation differences - Data density effects 4.3 Temporal Stratification \u00b6 Analysis is performed for multiple time periods: - Full period (1895-present) - Early period (1895-1950) - Middle period (1951-1980) - Recent period (1981-present) 5. Interpretation Framework \u00b6 5.1 Evidence of Systematic Bias \u00b6 Strong evidence would include: 1. Consistent Direction : >70% of stations show positive trends 2. Statistical Significance : Network-wide trend p < 0.01 3. Large Magnitude : Mean trend >0.01\u00b0C/decade 4. Acceleration : Trends stronger in recent decades 5. Spatial Coherence : Similar trends across regions 5.2 Evidence Against Systematic Bias \u00b6 Would include: 1. Random Distribution : ~50% positive, ~50% negative trends 2. No Significance : Network-wide p > 0.05 3. Small Magnitude : |Mean trend| <0.005\u00b0C/decade 4. Temporal Stability : No acceleration over time 5. Spatial Heterogeneity : Regional differences dominate 5.3 Alternative Explanations \u00b6 Consider whether patterns could result from: 1. Legitimate adjustments : Documented station changes 2. Urban growth : Increasing UHI requiring correction 3. Network changes : Shifting station composition 4. Methodology artifacts : Statistical or computational issues 6. Uncertainty Quantification \u00b6 6.1 Sources of Uncertainty \u00b6 Measurement uncertainty : \u00b10.1\u00b0C typical Adjustment uncertainty : Undocumented changes Sampling uncertainty : Incomplete station coverage Trend uncertainty : Regression standard errors 6.2 Propagation Methods \u00b6 Bootstrap resampling : 1000 iterations with replacement Jackknife : Leave-one-out station analysis Monte Carlo : Simulate measurement errors 6.3 Reporting \u00b6 All results reported with: - 95% confidence intervals - Standard errors - Sample sizes - Significance levels 7. Limitations \u00b6 7.1 Data Limitations \u00b6 Station coverage varies over time Missing data may not be random Adjustment algorithms have changed over time 7.2 Methodological Limitations \u00b6 Linear trends may oversimplify Spatial correlation not fully modeled Cannot separate all adjustment types 7.3 Interpretive Limitations \u00b6 Correlation does not imply causation Multiple hypotheses increase false positive risk Results specific to USHCN network 8. Validation Approaches \u00b6 8.1 Sensitivity Analysis \u00b6 Test robustness to: - Minimum data requirements - Trend calculation methods - Time period selection - Station selection criteria 8.2 Cross-Validation \u00b6 Compare with independent temperature datasets Check against satellite era (1979+) Validate with reanalysis products 8.3 Reproducibility \u00b6 All analysis code is: - Version controlled - Fully documented - Uses fixed random seeds - Includes data version information","title":"Detailed Methodology for Progressive Bias Investigation"},{"location":"studies/support/progressive-warming-bias-methodology/#detailed-methodology-for-progressive-bias-investigation","text":"","title":"Detailed Methodology for Progressive Bias Investigation"},{"location":"studies/support/progressive-warming-bias-methodology/#1-mathematical-framework","text":"","title":"1.

Using the USHCN dataset, we compare urban heat island intensity (UHII) across three data types: raw measurements, time-of-observation adjusted data, and fully adjusted data. Research Questions \u00b6 Primary Research Question \u00b6 Do NOAA adjustments systematically reduce urban heat island intensity, potentially masking legitimate urban warming signals? Secondary Research Questions \u00b6 Are urban stations adjusted more aggressively than rural stations? Which metropolitan areas show the largest UHII reductions after adjustment? Has urban adjustment bias increased over time periods? What is the magnitude of UHII reduction from raw to fully adjusted data?

This approach: - Uses the longest available high-quality data period - Focuses on minimum temperatures (strongest physical basis for urban effects) - Applies conservative urban/rural definitions - Employs standard climatological methods This ensures that any reduction in UHII from adjustments cannot be attributed to methodological bias in favor of finding adjustment problems.
