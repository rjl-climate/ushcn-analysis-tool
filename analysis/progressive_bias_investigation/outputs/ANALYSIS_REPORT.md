- `data/regional_statistics_max.csv` - Regional analysis
- `data/urban_rural_analysis_max.json` - Urban vs rural comparison
- `data/statistical_analysis_max.json` - Statistical tests

### Visualization Files

**MAX Temperature:**
- `plots/bias_timeseries_max.png` - Network-wide bias over time
- `plots/trend_distribution_max.png` - Distribution of station trends
- `plots/cumulative_bias_max.png` - Cumulative bias evolution
- `plots/regional_boxplot_max.png` - Regional trend comparison
- `plots/urban_rural_boxplot_max.png` - Urban vs rural comparison
- `plots/statistical_tests_max.png` - Statistical test results

## Quick Results Summary

### MAX Temperature

- **Stations analyzed:** 1218
- **Mean bias trend:** 0.035 °C/decade
- **Stations with significant positive trend:** 665 (54.6%)
- **Urban mean trend:** 0.028 °C/decade
- **Rural mean trend:** 0.040 °C/decade
- **Urban vs Rural difference:** No significant difference between urban and rural bias trends

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Evidence of Progressive Bias Would Include:
- Majority of stations showing positive bias trends
- Statistically significant network-wide positive trend
- Similar patterns in rural stations (no urban effects to correct)
- Acceleration of bias in recent decades
- Spatial correlation of trends across distant stations

### Evidence Against Progressive Bias Would Include:
- Random distribution of positive and negative trends
- No significant network-wide trend
- Different patterns for urban vs rural stations
- Adjustments clustered around documented station changes
- No systematic temporal patterns

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review detailed results** in the FINDINGS.md document
2. **Examine visualizations** to understand spatial and temporal patterns
3. **Compare with known station history** to identify legitimate adjustments
4. **Consider additional analyses** based on initial findings
5. **Document conclusions** and implications for temperature record reliability
