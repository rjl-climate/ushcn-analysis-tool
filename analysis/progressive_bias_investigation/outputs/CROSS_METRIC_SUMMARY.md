# Cross-Metric Progressive Bias Analysis Summary

**Generated:** 2025-06-29 16:47:48

## Key Findings Across Temperature Metrics

### Bias Magnitude Ranking (Strongest to Weakest):
1. **MAX**: 0.035 °C/decade (54.6% stations positive)
2. **AVG**: 0.018 °C/decade (48.9% stations positive)
3. **MIN**: 0.002 °C/decade (41.1% stations positive)

### Urban vs Rural Patterns:
- **AVG**: Urban 0.019, Rural 0.019 °C/decade (not significantly different)
- **MIN**: Urban 0.011, Rural -0.001 °C/decade (not significantly different)
- **MAX**: Urban 0.028, Rural 0.040 °C/decade (not significantly different)

### Cross-Metric Correlations:
- **AVG VS MIN**: r = 0.739 (n = 1218 stations)
- **AVG VS MAX**: r = 0.607 (n = 1218 stations)
- **MIN VS MAX**: r = -0.086 (n = 1218 stations)

### Evidence for Progressive Bias:
- **Positive bias prevalence**: ✗ All metrics show >50% stations with positive trends
- **Substantial magnitude**: ✓ At least one metric shows >0.02°C/decade trend
- **Rural bias patterns**: ✗ All metrics show positive rural bias

### Overall Assessment:
**MODERATE EVIDENCE** for progressive bias
