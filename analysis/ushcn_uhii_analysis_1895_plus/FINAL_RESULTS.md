## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully completed enhanced Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) analysis using network quality-informed methodology starting from 1895. This approach eliminates problematic sparse coverage artifacts from the early USHCN network period, providing more credible and scientifically defensible results.

## 📈 **COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS**

| Metric | Previous (1865+) | Enhanced (1895+) | Change |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Summer Max UHII** | 0.64°C | **0.588°C** | -8.1% |
| **Minimum UHII** | 2.88°C | **2.975°C** | +3.3% |
| **Start Year** | 1865 | **1895** | +30 years |
| **Initial Station Count** | 17 | **1,036** | +61x |

### Key Insights
- **Maximum Temperature:** Slightly reduced UHII reflects more representative sampling
- **Minimum Temperature:** Increased UHII indicates stronger nighttime retention signal
- **Enhanced Credibility:** Results based on adequate spatial coverage throughout
