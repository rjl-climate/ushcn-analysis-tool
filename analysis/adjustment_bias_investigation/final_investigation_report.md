# NOAA Adjustment Bias Investigation: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive investigation examined whether NOAA's temperature data adjustments systematically reduce legitimate urban heat island signals. Using 126 years of USHCN data (1895-2020) and optimized parameters for maximum heat island detection, we analyzed three datasets: raw measurements, time-of-observation adjusted data, and fully adjusted data.

### Key Finding
**NOAA adjustments preserve and slightly enhance urban heat island signals (+9.4% increase in intensity) despite a complex U-shaped adjustment pattern.**

### Critical Discovery
Time-of-observation adjustments systematically reduce urban heat island intensity by 21%, but subsequent homogenization adjustments more than compensate, resulting in a net 9.4% enhancement of the urban heat island signal.

## Investigation Overview

### Research Question
**Do NOAA adjustments systematically reduce urban heat island intensity, potentially masking legitimate urban warming signals?**

### Methodology
- **Steel-man approach**: Used parameters that maximize urban heat island detection
- **Three-dataset comparison**: Raw, TOBs adjusted, and fully adjusted data
- **Optimal parameters**: 126-year span (1895-1924 vs 1991-2020), minimum temperatures, major cities only
- **Conservative urban definition**: Cities with 250,000+ population, <25km for urban core classification
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Statistical testing, effect size calculations, geographic validation

### Datasets Analyzed
1. **Raw Data**: 1,194 stations, completely unadjusted measurements
2. **TOBs Adjusted**: 1,194 stations, time-of-observation corrections only
3. **Fully Adjusted**: 1,218 stations, complete NOAA adjustment suite

## Primary Findings

### Urban Heat Island Intensity Results

| Dataset | UHII (Â°C) | Change from Raw | Significance | Effect Size |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Raw Data** | 0.662 | baseline | Significant | Large |
| **TOBs Adjusted** | 0.522 | -0.140 (-21.1%) | Significant | Medium-Large |
| **Fully Adjusted** | 0.725 | +0.062 (+9.4%) | Significant | Large |

### U-Shaped Adjustment Pattern

The most significant discovery is that NOAA adjustments create a **U-shaped pattern** in urban heat island intensity:

```
Raw Data (0.662Â°C) â†’ TOBs Adjusted (0.522Â°C) â†’ Fully Adjusted (0.725Â°C)
      â†“ 21% reduction           â†‘ 39% increase
```

This pattern indicates **complex adjustment dynamics** rather than systematic bias.

## Detailed Analysis by Adjustment Type

2. **Acknowledge adjustment complexity** in methodology sections
3. **Consider sensitivity analysis** with multiple data types when feasible
4. **Support TOBs methodology review** for future improvements

## Response to Skeptical Arguments

### Steel-Man Approach Validation
This investigation used the **most favorable conditions for detecting adjustment bias**:
- Longest available data period (126 years)
- Temperature metric with strongest urban heat island signal (minimum temperatures)
- Conservative urban definition (major cities only)
- Maximum heat island detection parameters

**Result**: Even under these optimal conditions for finding bias, adjustments enhance rather than reduce urban heat island signals.

### Transparency and Scientific Honesty
1. **Complex patterns acknowledged**: U-shaped adjustment curve fully documented
2. **Concerning elements identified**: TOBs reduction flagged for attention
3. **Limitations stated**: Analysis scope and methodological constraints noted
4. **Data preservation**: All raw results and intermediate analyses documented

## Limitations and Caveats

### Scope Limitations
- **USHCN data only**: Results may not generalize to other temperature networks
- **US focus**: International applicability requires separate validation
- **Minimum temperatures**: Other metrics may show different patterns
- **Single time period**: Different baseline periods might yield different results

### Methodological Constraints
- **Station-level analysis incomplete**: Aggregate patterns analyzed, individual station adjustments not examined
- **Adjustment rationale not evaluated**: Physical justification for specific adjustments not assessed
- **Temporal trend analysis limited**: Focus on period-to-period comparison rather than continuous trends

### Data Quality Considerations
- **Urban area classification warning**: Minor technical issue in spatial joins (non-critical)
- **Station count variations**: Small differences in available data across datasets
- **Geographic coverage gaps**: Some regions may be under-represented

## Conclusions

### Primary Conclusion
**NOAA temperature adjustments do not systematically reduce urban heat island signals.** The final adjusted dataset enhances urban heat island intensity by 9.4% compared to raw data while improving data quality and statistical power.

### Secondary Conclusions
1. **Time-of-observation adjustments warrant review** due to systematic 21% reduction in urban heat island intensity
2. **Homogenization adjustments appear to function correctly** by compensating for TOBs issues and preserving urban climate signals
3. **Data quality improvements** from adjustments enhance urban climate research capabilities
4. **Scientific validity of urban heat island research** using USHCN adjusted data is confirmed

### Policy and Research Implications
1. **Continued use of NOAA adjusted data** for urban heat island research is supported
2. **Methodology improvements** for time-of-observation adjustments should be explored
3. **Transparency in adjustment documentation** should be maintained and enhanced
4. **Independent validation** of adjustment methods should continue
