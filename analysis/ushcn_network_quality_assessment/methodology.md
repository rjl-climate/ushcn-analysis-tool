# Network Quality Assessment Methodology

## Analytical Framework

This document defines the comprehensive methodology for assessing USHCN network coverage quality and its impact on historical temperature trend reliability. The analysis addresses fundamental questions about the validity of pre-1900 climate data and the potential for network-induced trend artifacts.

## Core Research Design

### **Objective 2: Evaluate Geographic Bias**
Determine how spatial coverage evolution affects representativeness of continental temperature calculations and introduces systematic biases.

### **Objective 3: Validate Trend Reliability**
Establish minimum network coverage requirements for credible climate trend analysis and identify periods where coverage is inadequate.

### **Objective 4: Assess Climate Policy Implications**
Evaluate how network quality issues affect historical climate assessments and provide recommendations for data interpretation standards.
