# Research Studies

We use the USHCN Temperature Data Analysis Tool to support a growing number of research studies investigating the USHCN temperature datasets.

## Urban Heat Island Contamination

In [this study](uhi-contamination), we examine the effectivess of NOAA's homogenisation method for removing Urban Heat Island contamination. We discovered that NOAA adjustments enhance urban heat island signals by **9.4%** rather than removing them, with **22.7%** of USHCN stations experiencing urban heat island contamination averaging **0.725°C**.

## Progressive Warming Bias

in [this study](progressive-warming-bias), we investigate evidence of systematic artificial warming in the US temperature record. We discovered that NOAA's F52 adjustments introduce progressive warming bias beyond legitimate time-of-observation corrections, with maximum temperatures showing **0.035°C/decade** artificial warming (~0.45°C since 1895) and identical bias patterns in urban and rural stations providing "smoking gun" evidence of systematic artifacts.
