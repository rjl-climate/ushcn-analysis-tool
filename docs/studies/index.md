# Research Studies

We use the USHCN Temperature Data Analysis Tool to support a growing number of research studies investigating the USHCN temperature datasets.

## Urban Heat Island Contamination

In [this study](uhi-contamination), we examine the effectivess of NOAA's homogenisation method for removing Urban Heat Island contamination. We discovered that NOAA adjustments enhance urban heat island signals by **9.4%** rather than removing them, with **22.7%** of USHCN stations experiencing urban heat island contamination averaging **0.725Â°C**.
