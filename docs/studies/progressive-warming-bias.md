# Progressive Warming Bias in NOAA Temperature Adjustments

## A 128-year investigation revealing systematic artificial warming in the US temperature record

!!! abstract "Key Finding"
    NOAA's F52 adjustments introduce progressive warming bias beyond legitimate time-of-observation corrections, with maximum temperatures showing 0.035Â°C/decade artificial warming (~0.45Â°C since 1895) and identical bias patterns in urban and rural stations providing "smoking gun" evidence of systematic artifacts.

## Executive Summary

This study investigates whether NOAA's F52 temperature adjustments introduce progressive warming bias by analyzing 1,218 USHCN stations over 128 years (1895-2023). By isolating non-TOB adjustments and comparing urban versus rural stations, we demonstrate that homogenization procedures systematically add warming to the temperature record rather than removing environmental biases.

### Primary Results

| Temperature Metric | Bias Trend (Â°C/decade) | Cumulative Since 1895 | Stations Affected | Urban Trend | Rural Trend |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Maximum** | 0.035 | ~0.45Â°C | 54.6% (665/1218) | 0.028 | **0.040** |
| **Average** | 0.018 | ~0.23Â°C | 48.9% (596/1218) | **0.019** | **0.019** |
| **Minimum** | 0.002 | ~0.03Â°C | 41.1% (501/1218) | 0.011 | -0.001 |

### "Smoking Gun" Evidence

The urban-rural comparison reveals the critical finding:

- **Average temperature**: Identical bias in urban (0.019) and rural (0.019) stations
- **Maximum temperature**: Rural stations receive *larger* warming adjustments than urban
- **Significance**: Rural stations have no urban heat island effects requiring correction

This pattern cannot be reconciled with legitimate environmental adjustments.

## Research Context

### The Challenge

The integrity of temperature records depends on adjustment procedures designed to remove non-climatic artifacts:

- Station relocations
- Equipment changes
- Time-of-observation shifts
- Environmental modifications

NOAA applies multi-stage adjustments progressing from raw data through TOB corrections to fully adjusted (F52) datasets. The systematic impact of these adjustments on long-term trends has profound implications for climate assessments.

### Progressive Bias Hypothesis

If adjustment procedures introduce systematic warming over time, this would:
- Contaminate temperature trend calculations
- Affect climate model validation
- Compromise attribution studies
- Impact policy decisions based on warming magnitude

## Methodology

### Mathematical Framework

For each station _i_ at time _t_, we calculated adjustment bias:

```
Bias(i,t) = F52_temp(i,t) - TOB_temp(i,t)
```

This isolates homogenization impacts from well-understood TOB corrections.

### Analysis Design

- **Period**: 1895-2023 (128 years)
- **Network**: 1,218 USHCN stations
- **Metrics**: Minimum, average, and maximum temperatures
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression of bias over time
- **Quality Control**: Minimum 10 years data, â‰¥6 months/year

### Urban-Rural Classification

Critical for testing whether adjustments respond to real factors:

- **Urban**: Within 100 km of cities >50,000 population
- **Rural**: >100 km from any city >50,000 population
- **Temporal Filter**: Stations must have data from â‰¤1905

### Statistical Framework

- Individual station significance via t-tests
- Network-wide Mann-Kendall tests
- Spatial autocorrelation via Moran's I
- Bootstrap uncertainty quantification

## Key Findings

Maximum temperature adjustments show the most severe contamination, with over half of all stations affected.

### Regional Analysis

| Region | Stations | Mean Bias Trend | Significance | % Positive |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Northeast | 106 | 0.028Â°C/decade | p<0.001 âœ“ | 58.5% |
| Southeast | 287 | 0.024Â°C/decade | p<0.001 âœ“ | 51.9% |
| Midwest | 275 | 0.016Â°C/decade | p<0.001 âœ“ | 49.5% |
| Northwest | 106 | 0.022Â°C/decade | p<0.01 âœ“ | 50.0% |
| South | 58 | 0.007Â°C/decade | p=0.48 | 41.4% |
| Southwest | 90 | 0.012Â°C/decade | p=0.18 | 44.4% |
| West | 26 | 0.007Â°C/decade | p=0.72 | 46.2% |

Four of seven regions show statistically significant positive bias.

### Spatial Patterns

- **Moran's I**: 0.029 (p=0.303)
- **Interpretation**: No spatial autocorrelation
- **Significance**: Bias applied systematically, not regionally coordinated

### Statistical Robustness

- **Network-wide significance**: p < 0.001 for average and maximum
- **Bonferroni corrections**: Results remain significant
- **Bootstrap validation**: 95% CIs exclude zero
- **Mann-Kendall test**: Ï„ = 0.687 (p < 0.001)

## Implications

### For US Temperature Records

With progressive bias ranging from 0.03Â°C to 0.45Â°C since 1895:

- Maximum temperature trends inflated by ~0.035Â°C/decade
- Average temperature trends inflated by ~0.018Â°C/decade
- Nearly half of all stations systematically biased upward
- Cumulative warming substantially overstated

### Global Extrapolation

If similar procedures are applied internationally:

- Global temperature records likely contain comparable biases
- Densely populated regions may show larger effects
- Climate sensitivity estimates require reassessment
- Temperature targets need recalibration

### Climate Science Impact

- **Model Validation**: Calibrated against biased observations
- **Attribution Studies**: Artificial warming conflated with forcing
- **Policy Decisions**: Based on inflated warming estimates
- **Trend Analysis**: Systematic overestimation of warming rates
